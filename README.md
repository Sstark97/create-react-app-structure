# Description

These is my react personal structure when I builld a Rect Project with `create-react-app`. I add four folders in src:

- Assets: Here I save styles and static resources like images
- Components: Here I save my React Components
- Containers: Here I save a Container of components
- pages: Here I save different's pages if I need to use a router

In addition I use ChakraUI to add Style to my Components. Also in these repo you can find a basic Layout with a Header, Main and Footer Component.
